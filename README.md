## #1: TrackExpenses
<i>
tl;drTrackExpenses is a simple web application written with Django that helps you visualize how you spend your money in relation to your budget.

### Background:
The idea was born out of frustration; in college I have a very tight budget and therefore I try to spend money carefully. Nonetheless, I almost always end up overspending, and while sometimes I knew I had to make those one-time purchases, I still had no clear idea I actually stayed on budget for my other expenses.

### My solution:
There are countless of options for the money tracking problem. I’ve used similar apps in the past and found them complicated, and usually overloaded with functionalities that I didn’t need. My main concern was that entering my expenses would be quick and painless. I envisioned a wide, single bar, just like the one in Google Search, where I could enter my expenses. Secondly, I wanted to view them in a single window, divided by a few categories. In the future, I plan to add some additional visualization tools and suggestions to optimize the budget.
